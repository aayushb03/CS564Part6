After reading over the project independently, we all met together on 12/06 to clear up any misunderstandings and begin work on the select.C functionality
On 12/08 and 12/09, we also all met to finish the code for all files, validating that the tests are correct.

We pair programmed, while one of us was responsible for error lookup and answering questions.
Preston drove fro the select.C, Dane drove for the delete.C, and Aayush drove for the insert.C
